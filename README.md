# Chapter-6: Using Common Widgets
### What I Learned
I explored various common Flutter widgets, such as Text for displaying text, Image for adding visuals, and layout widgets like ListView and GridView for creating scrollable and grid-based layouts. Additionally, I learned how to style and customize these widgets using properties like alignment, padding, colors, and text styles to enhance their visual appeal and functionality.

### Achievement
I successfully built a contact list app that uses ListView for displaying contacts in a vertical scrollable format and GridView for arranging items in a grid layout. This project demonstrated my ability to combine, style, and customize widgets effectively to create a functional and attractive UI.
